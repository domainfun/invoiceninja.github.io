It's usually calculated as a percentage and added to the price of a product or service at the point of sale. Unlike some countries where a value-added tax (VAT) is utilized, in the U.S., there is no national sales tax. Instead, sales tax is levied at the state, county, and sometimes even at the municipal level, making it somewhat complex.This means that the sales tax can vary significantly from one location to another, not just from state to state, but even within a state. For example, in one city, the total sales tax might be 6%, while in another, it might be 9%. Some states, like Oregon and Delaware, don't impose any sales tax at all.Products and services can also be taxed differently. For instance, some states tax groceries, while others don't. Similarly, some states offer tax holidays, specific times during the year when sales tax is not charged on certain items.To accurately calculate sales tax, it's important to know:\nThe precise location of the sale (the \"nexus\").\nThe type of product or service being sold.\nThe current tax rate in that location.\nInvoice Ninja can simplify this process for you by automating the sales tax calculation.

Some states tax all services, some tax only certain services, while others don't tax services at all. For instance, repair and maintenance services might be taxed in one state, but not in another. Similarly, professional services such as legal or consulting services may be exempt in some states, but taxable in others.To handle the range of tax possibilities you can assign tax categories to your products.The available tax categories are as follows:\nPhysical Goods\nDigital Products\nServices\nShipping\nTax Exempt\nReduced Tax\nOverride Tax\nZero Rated\nReverse Tax (Use Tax)\n"},{"id":51,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#physical-goods","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Physical Goods","body":"Sales tax on physical goods, also known as tangible personal property, is one of the most common forms of sales tax in the United States.

While it might seem similar to tax-exempt items, there is a crucial difference. When an item is zero-rated, it technically remains taxable, but at a rate of 0%. The key advantage here is that while the end consumer doesn't pay any tax on these goods or services, the businesses involved in the supply chain may still reclaim input taxes (if applicable), something that is not allowed for tax-exempt items.However, it's important to note that the concept of zero-rated goods is more commonly associated with countries that use a Value Added Tax (VAT) system, such as those in the European Union or Canada. In these systems, certain essential goods like food or books are often zero-rated to reduce the cost burden on consumers, while still allowing businesses to claim back VAT they've paid on inputs.In the United States, which uses a sales tax system rather than VAT, the concept of zero-rating doesn't apply in the same way. Instead, states usually categorize goods and services as either taxable, exempt, or taxable at a reduced rate."},{"id":58,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#reverse-tax-(use-tax)","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Reverse Tax (Use Tax)","body":"The concept of \"reverse tax\" is often used in the context of \"use tax\". In the United States, a use tax is typically a type of tax charged to consumers who purchase goods or services from outside their home state for use in their home state, and where no sales tax has been charged.Essentially, use tax is the counterpart to sales tax and is designed to discourage consumers from buying out-of-state in order to avoid sales tax. It also helps to level the playing field between in-state retailers (who have to charge sales tax) and out-of-state retailers (who often don't).The rate of use tax is generally the same as the sales tax that would have been charged if the purchase had been made in-state. Therefore, if you buy an item tax-free from an online retailer located in another state, but you use the item in your home state, you're usually responsible for paying use tax to your state.Keep in mind, it's typically the buyer's responsibility to calculate, report, and remit use tax to the appropriate tax authority. This can get complicated for businesses making numerous out-of-state purchases. However, some states require larger businesses or those with a significant presence (nexus) in the state to charge use tax at the point of sale, effectively reversing the normal taxation process, hence the term \"reverse tax\"."},{"id":59,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#tax-exemptions","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Tax Exemptions","body":"In the realm of sales tax, tax exemptions are specific scenarios where sales tax does not have to be paid on certain goods, services, or transactions. These exemptions are set by the tax authority, often at the state level in the United States, and can vary greatly from one state to another.Product-based Exemptions: Certain types of goods may be exempt from sales tax. For example, necessities like groceries and prescription medications are often tax-exempt. Clothing is also exempt in some states, and many states offer temporary exemptions for back-to-school supplies during certain periods of the year.Use-based Exemptions: This refers to situations where an item is used in a way that qualifies it to be tax-exempt. For instance, goods that are purchased for resale are often exempt from sales tax, as the tax will ultimately be paid by the end consumer. Similarly, items used in manufacturing or items purchased by non-profit organizations are often tax-exempt.Buyer-based Exemptions: In some cases, the buyer's status can lead to a tax exemption. For instance, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and certain other groups may not have to pay sales tax on their purchases.Transaction-based Exemptions: Certain types of sales transactions may be exempt from sales tax. For example, sales involving interstate commerce may be exempt in some cases.If you sell goods and services to a client who is tax exempt, you can mark them as tax exempt by editing their client record and setting the tax exempt switch on."},{"id":60,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#configure-eu-tax-calculations","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Configure EU tax calculations","body":""},{"id":61,"uri":"\/en\/taxes\/#settings.","title":"Taxes","sub_title":"Settings.","body":"The calculation engine for the EU has recently been updated to support EU wide tax calculations!

One of the values that can be set in this file is \"APP_DEBUG\". This value controls whether or not detailed error messages are displayed when an error occurs in the application.When \"APP_DEBUG\" is set to \"true\", Laravel will display detailed error messages that can include sensitive information such as the file path, database credentials, and other configuration details. This information can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the application and its underlying infrastructure.Leaving \"APP_DEBUG\" set to \"true\" in a production environment is a security concern because it can allow attackers to gain valuable information about the application and its environment. Attackers can use this information to craft targeted attacks against the application or its users, and can also use it to gain unauthorized access to the underlying infrastructure.To mitigate this security concern, it is recommended to set \"APP_DEBUG\" to \"false\" in the \".env\" file of a production environment. This will prevent detailed error messages from being displayed and help to protect the application and its users from potential attacks. Additionally, it is important to ensure that all sensitive information is properly secured and not exposed in error messages or other application outputs.The following CVEs have been reported exploiting this:\nCVE-2020-15168: Laravel 7.x before 7.27.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of an \"Unrestricted File Upload\" vulnerability via a request to \"\/debugbar\/file\".\nCVE-2019-16785: Laravel Framework through 5.8.35 allows unauthorized remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted web site that is mishandled by the \"artisan serve\" command.\nCVE-2018-15133: In Laravel Framework through 5.5.40 and 5.6.x through 5.6.29, remote code execution might occur as a result of an unserialize call on a potentially untrusted X-XSRF-TOKEN value, because of the fallback mechanism for CSRF tokens.\nThese vulnerabilities demonstrate the potential for serious security issues when APP_DEBUG=true is left enabled in a production environment. It is therefore crucial to take appropriate security measures to protect against these types of attacks."},{"id":130,"uri":"\/en\/hosted-migration\/#v4-hosted-to-v5-hosted","title":"Hosted migration","sub_title":"V4 Hosted to V5 Hosted","body":"Migrating to v5 for hosted users should be a straight forward process.First navigate toSettings \/ Account Managementand click on the Start Migration button.The next screen will display all of your companies which are available for migration.

For example tapping on the 'Clients' option in the sidebar will load the clients view, whereas long\ntapping it will instead create a new client. This pattern is used throughout the app.Two other examples are you can long press an invoice on the dashboard to navigate directly to the edit screen and long pressing the edit button on the tables will start multi-select and select the record.Some fields (such as date and time) support shorthand input and provide a preview of the selected value. For example, you can select enter April 4th in the date field by typing 404 and 1.5 in a time field will be converted to one and a half hours.The app version (ie. v5.1.56-A47) is comprised of two parts: the API version and the Admin Portal version.

To start, simply create a new template inSettings \/ Invoice Design \/ Custom DesignsYou will see that along with providing a name for the design\/template, there is a new selector which allows you to choose whether the design is a regular design (ie for invoices \/ quotes) or a template which can also be a custom design, but also includes the power twig syntax and data to create bespoke templates.After selecting the template option, a series of checkboxes will appear where you can associate the data types with the template. This is an important step as it allows us to provide the menu options for this template in the correct location and also provides the correct context when running the template;for example, if you select the invoice checkbox, the system will be able to prepare your invoice\/s to be run through the template. You can select multiple options here and the system will ensure this data is prepared and ready for use in the template.How did we construct this? Lets take a look at a template sample:Embedded in the html\/css is a dedicated set of <ninja><\/ninja> tags, this tells the template engine that we are now using the Twig Templating system.Templates always assume that the data being processed in an array of objects.

Use this when you intent to forward along the payment gateway fees to the customer. For example, if the payment processing fee for your Stripe account is 30 cents flat, and 1%, and you wanted to pass that to the customer, you would enter a 0.30 flat Fee Amount, and 1 for Fee Percent, and enable the Adjust Fee Percent. Because the total with fees will be higher, the actual fees Stripe charges will be higher also. With this feature, Invoice Ninja will calculate and adjust the fee to charge the customer the expected fee amount, after the final invoice price is changed.\n\nNote - When attempting to perfectly capture the payment gateway fee 100% and apply it to the client's payment using Adjust Fee Percent, you must disable Invoice Tax Rates and exclusively use Item Tax Rates (Basic Settings > Tax Settings). When a payment fee is applied to a customer invoice, it is entered as a line item, and any invoice tax rates will be applied to the fee, which will throw off the formula to calculate the new fee percent correctly.\nYou are responsible for verifying that your tax and fee settings comply with any laws that apply.

Links","sub_title":"Introduction","body":"Payment Links (previously known as Subscriptions) are a supercharged version of our Buy Now links from version 4.In version 5, payment links allow you to build an instant shop front where you can bundle your existing products into direct link purchases.When you create a payment link, a direct link is generated which is available to use to directly purchase the given product(s). This could be suitable for digital sales that are one time, or recurring, or even both at once.When you create the payment link you are able to combine one time and recurring products into a single payment link. For example, lets say you run a hosting business and want to create a payment link which has a single Setup charge as well as a monthly recurring charge for the server.When your client purchases this, the Setup charge will only be applied to the first invoice, and then a recurring invoice is generated for any recurring products in the payment link.If you want to allow your clients to move between subscriptions then this is possible by creating a Group and adding each payment link to the group. This bundles all of the payment links tagged with the same group together!The settings pane allows you to define the frequency \/ auto billing and also promo codes\/discounts.
